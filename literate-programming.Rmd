## YRBSS

About the data, what we want to do with this report.

Load one year's worth of data as a standalone example.

```{r read_data, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
yrbssNM2019 <- read_excel("./data/sadcqn_nm2019.xlsx")

# Too many variables for this to look good in the nb
# summary(yrbssNM2019)
```

Get information about the imported data.

```{r}
# spec(yrbssNM2019) # doesn't work on Excel
problems(yrbssNM2019)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r yrbssNMplot, echo=FALSE}
plot(x = yrbssNM2019$bmi, y = yrbssNM2019$age)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

The data include many categorical variables - if we want to run certain 
models we will have to fix this. But for now we can draw more informative plots
and interrogate the dataset with the data as-is.

```{r proportion_table}
# note that sum of all values is 1
prop.table(table(yrbssNM2019$grade, yrbssNM2019$sex))
```

Plot the above.

```{r plot sex/grade}
ggplot(yrbssNM2019, mapping = aes(x = grade, y = stweight)) + 
         geom_point(aes(color = stheight, size = bmi))
```
