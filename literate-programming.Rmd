```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r load_packages, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

## YRBSS

About the data, what we want to do with this report.

Load one year's worth of data as a standalone example.

```{r read_data, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
yrbssNM2019 <- read_excel("./data/sadq_nm2019.xlsx")

# Too many variables for this to look good in the nb
# summary(yrbssNM2019)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r yrbssNMplot, echo=FALSE}
plot(x = yrbssNM2019$bmi, y = yrbssNM2019$age)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
